## Project Proposal
- Abdullah suggests "miniature rover" as the project proposal.
- It works to the strength of different members of the group, they agree.
- The capabilities and limitations of the project are discussed. 

### Minimum Capabilities
[] Open-loop movement with manual control
[] Durable build 
[] Visual sensory using camera sensor (at least one)
[] Remote-control from base station
[] Networking between multiple computers

### Should further have
[] Closed-loop movement with manual control
[] Suspension for shock absorption
[] Sufficient sensory to detect and formulate local map
[] Data Collection of Different sensors
[] Robotic-Arm 

### Optimistically will further have
[] Closed-loop semi-autonomous movement
[] Autonomous movement of Robotic Arm
